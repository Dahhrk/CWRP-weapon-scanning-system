# CWRP Weapon Scanning System

The CWRP Weapon Scanning System is a powerful tool designed to enhance roleplay (RP) realism by enabling detailed weapon scanning and confiscation capabilities. It allows for streamlined security processes within the Clone Wars RP (CWRP) community.

## Usage Instructions

### Overview
Guards who use the weapon scanners and confiscators must be trained and authorized. Typically, these roles include:

- **5th Fleet Security**
- **Regimental Commanders or above**

These positions are crucial for maintaining RP authenticity and ensuring that security protocols are enforced accurately and fairly. Only players assigned to one of these roles should handle these tools.

### Key Features
1. **Weapon Scanning**:
   - Scans weapons being carried by individuals to ensure compliance with security protocols.
2. **Weapon Confiscation**:
   - Confiscate prohibited items securely and log the details for review.
3. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Validate the authority level of the scanning personnel.

### Roleplay Guidelines
- Always treat scanned individuals with respect and adhere to community rules.
- Ensure that scanning and confiscation actions are logged for transparency and accountability purposes.
- Use the scanner and confiscator tools sparingly to avoid disrupting RP flow unnecessarily.

### Important Notes
The use of the Weapon Scanning System is not only a matter of enforcement but also a significant contributor to creating an immersive and authentic RP experience. Guards play an essential part in setting the tone of the RP environment and reinforcing the rules of the community.
